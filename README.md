Quote I remember myself every day working on the Frontend:

> Initially, design your state, stores, processes as if you were building a CLI, not a web app ([Michel Weststrate](https://michel.codes/blogs/ui-as-an-afterthought))

This quote means more than you think:
> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things (Phil Karlton)
